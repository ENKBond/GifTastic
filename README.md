# GifTastic

The purpose of this gif site is to display still images of various actors using buttons at the top of the page.

When the user clicks a button at the top of the page, up to 10 gifs of that actor whose name is on the button will display with a still iamge. When the user clicks on an image, the gif will animate. When the user clicks on the same image again, the gif will return to a still image. 

The user can add additional buttons to the top of the page by typing in an actor's name in the "Add an actor" box and clicking on the "submit" button. Then an additonal button with the new actor's name will appear at the top, and if clicked, it will display gifs in a similar manner to all other buttons.

Additionally, when the user clicks on the title of the "Add an actor" box, a popup box will appear and can be dismissed with an "X" close button.
